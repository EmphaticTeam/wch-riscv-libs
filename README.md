## Introduction

WCH RISC-V Microcontroller Libraries are designed to facilitate the development of embedded applications for WCH microcontrollers using the RISC-V architecture. Whether you're building IoT devices, robotics, or any other embedded system, these libraries provide a solid foundation for your projects.

## Libraries

### Low-Level (LL) Libraries

The Low-Level (LL) libraries offer direct access to the hardware peripherals and registers of WCH microcontrollers. These libraries provide fine-grained control over the hardware, making them suitable for advanced users who require maximum flexibility and optimization.

Features of the LL libraries include:

- Direct register manipulation
- Hardware-specific configurations
- Low-level hardware access

### High-Level (HAL) Libraries

The High-Level (HAL) libraries, on the other hand, provide a higher level of abstraction for WCH microcontroller development. They simplify the interaction with hardware peripherals and offer a more user-friendly API for those who want to get started quickly and focus on application development.

Features of the HAL libraries include:

- Abstraction of hardware details
- Ready-to-use functions for common tasks
- Simplified API for rapid development

## Getting Started

To get started with the WCH RISC-V Microcontroller Libraries, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the documentation to understand how to use the libraries effectively.
3. Choose between the Low-Level (LL) or High-Level (HAL) libraries based on your project requirements.
4. Start developing your embedded application with ease.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for each library can be found in the `docs` directory of this repository. You'll find detailed guides, API references, and examples to help you make the most of the libraries.
